* Introductory Graph Theory
** Elementary Concepts of Graph Theory
  - Theorem: For any (p,q) graphs G, the sum of the degrees of vertices of G is equal to twice the number of edges of G.
  - Where the order p of graph G is the number of vertices and the size q of graph G is the number of edges.
  - Let v equal any vertice.
  - \\[ \sum_{i=1}^p deg\,v_i = 2q \\]
